"""As-of reads: what the store knew at a time.

A game result is known once the game is over. The store does not keep the end time, so a
result counts as known ``RESULT_DELAY`` after the start. Starter and injury reads are known
from their fetch time. The result tables have no fetch-time limit: a backfill fetches old
games late, and the backtest must still see them.

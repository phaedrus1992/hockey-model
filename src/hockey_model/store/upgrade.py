"""Upgrade a store file to the current schema version, keeping every row.

Only this producer step migrates a store. The open path in ``store/db.py`` validates the
version and never changes the file. The upgrade takes the write lock, copies the store
with SQLite's backup API, applies the ordered changes in one transaction, and records each
run in ``schema_migrations``. The lock is taken before the copy, so no write can land
between the backup and the migration.

A version 1 store has no attempt counts. The upgrade rebuilds ``mp_team_games`` so that its
rows keep their values, the counts are NULL, and ``attempts_known`` is 0. No count is
filled in, because the value at the old fetch time is unknown.
